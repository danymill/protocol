# Peer-to-Peer Networking
## Overview

The Spacemesh protocol creates a global, distributed, shared ledger. This means that each Spacemesh node must hold all transactions created by all other Spacemesh nodes. Also, nodes participate in [consensus algorithms](../consensus/01-overview.md) and listen to [PoET server](../mining/03-poet.md) results. All of this requires the nodes to have a communication infrastructure to transport and propagate messages across the network. For this, Spacemesh nodes use a proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol. Using P2P technology allows  nodes to efficiently transmit messages without the need for a centralized message server.

## What is P2P?

[Peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) is a distributed application architecture that allows sharing of data and resources between nodes, called peers, that are equally privileged. This architecture also distributes workloads by partitioning the network into smaller subnetworks where each node can access several other nodes in the same subnetwork.

Peer to peer technology was mainly used for file sharing, popularized by the file sharing network [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) and later by [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent). Ever since, many other file sharing platforms were created based on this architecture and also other usages such as a distributed file system, and of course blockchain technology.

Peer to peer is the perfect architecture for blockchain since it proved a means to connect to a network without using any centralized server, providing permissionless and efficient data sharing infra.
