# Peer-to-Peer Networking
## Overview

The Spacemesh protocol creates a global, distributed, shared ledger. This means that each Spacemesh node must hold all transactions created by all other Spacemesh nodes. Also, nodes participate in [consensus algorithms](../consensus/01-overview.md) and listen to [PoET server](../mining/03-poet.md) results. All of this requires the nodes to have a communication infrastructure to transport and propagate messages across the network. For this, Spacemesh nodes use a proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol. Using P2P technology allows  nodes to efficiently transmit messages without the need for a centralized message server.
